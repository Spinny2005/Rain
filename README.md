# Rain
Rain is a game/graphics engine built to be intuitive and easy to use. Rain aims to also be free of any all-encompassing traits, instead letting you decide how to use it and when to start using your own code to interact with OpenGL. To do this all OpenGL handles are public properties of their cooresponding classes in Rain, and can be used at will, though it should be noted that doing so may cause unwanted behavior when using the Rain class again if the OpenGL object has been modified.
